    <h2>What is Human Design?</h2>
</header>
    <p> Human Design gives you a personalised blueprint / energetic map of your soul and <b>who you are uniquely here to be.</b> 
        Its essentially a synthesis of four ancient, <i>esoteric wisdom systems:</i>
    <ul> 
        <li>Chinese I Ching</li>
        <li>Kabbalah Tree of Life</li>
        <li>Hindu Chakra</li>
        <li>Western Astrology</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Using your exact birth date, time and location, these wisdoms provide a tactical system that equips you to live life in the most efficient way and to use your energy to make decisions so that your life, relationships and career works with more flow and ease. Following your specific design can lead you to living a more authentically embodied life in your most natural mode of operation. It can help you answer some of lifes biggest questions!</p>
      <q>Human Design is not religious, it isnt spiritual, it isnt moralistic, its any of those things. Its just a mechanic.</q> - Ra Uru Hu
